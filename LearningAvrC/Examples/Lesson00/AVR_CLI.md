# How to code from Terminal

>[!TIP]
> Copy `blink.c` and `Makefile` to a folder (eg. **\<your dev folder\>/AVR_C/Lesson00**)
>
> ***edit Makefile*** to adapt PRGMER to your case/port
>
> open terminal there and\
> go `make <TAB> <TAB>` to see possible targets
> 
> Finally : `make` or `make upload`

>[!NOTE]
> I piped the `avr-readelf` output through `less` for readability
