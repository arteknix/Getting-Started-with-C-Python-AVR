# File Types and extensions in C

## Source
> [!TIP]
> **.c**  | **C** source \
> **.cpp** | **C++** source 


You could use code_source.banana, but it's not usefull since:
> [!CAUTION]
> the file extension defines features like\
> syntax-highlighting and\
> default application to use with file.

## Header
> [!NOTE]
> header-files contain information on how to use functions and variables from other files or libraries

> [!TIP]
> **.h** | C/C++ headers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `#include <file.h>` searches for _file.h_ in system\
> `#include "file.h"` searches for _file.h_ in folders relative to source/header file
 
## Objects and libraries
> [!NOTE]
> **.o**  | object file (compiled) \
> **.a** |  static library \
> **.so** |  dynamic library (**s**hared **o**bject)

## Other file types
> [!NOTE]
> **.elf**  | compiled elf format \
> **.hex** |  compiled intel hex format \
> **.bin** |  compiled binary
