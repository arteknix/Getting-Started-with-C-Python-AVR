# The essentials of C Language Syntax

C is a language with static strong typing,
This means that you cannot change a variable's type or size oubce you've declared it.\
You can only use variables you previously declared (or included from other files)

## Variable Types

Integers can be prefixed with _unsigned_

- As an example take _char_ which is 8 bit long, 2^8 = 256 values
  - char is from -128 to 127  [ -(2^8) /2 ; ((2^8) /2)-1 ]
  - unsigned char from 0 to 255 [ 0 ; (2^8)-1 ]


Integers can be prefixed with :
- long (l)
- unsigned long (ul)
- long long (ll)
- unsigned long long (ull)

numbers:
- bool
  - true or false
- char (signed/unsigned)
  - 8-bit = 1 byte
- short (signed/unsigned)
  - 2-byte 
- integer (signed/unsigned)
  - 4 8 16 byte depending on os/cpu
- long (signed/unsigned)
  - longer integer. if you need more you can use _long long_
- float
  - real number 
- double
  - double precision real number 

void: no variable/value
