# Getting-Started-with-C-Python-AVR
This is to get some friends started with a more complete way of using Atmels AVR microcontrollers.
Motivations are explained on the [wiki](https://github.com/arteknix/Getting-Started-with-C-Python-AVR/wiki#welcome-to-the-getting-started-with-c-python-avr-wiki) 
for the time being.

This file will be progressively updated

# Atmel AVR 8 bit microcontrollers
Atmel's AVR microcontrollers have first class functionalities and documentation.
Many examples illustrate every feature in the documentation.
The configuration registers have self-explanatory names.
Why write about apparently "simple" circuits if so many powerfull solutions exist ?

Well, my criticism on people's behaviour in  this field is that most of them never really dive into the subject. They go blink some leds and forget about the product soon after.
The concept here is to push it further by for example exploring register configurations, peripherals, Interrupt Service Routines (ISR), Timers, ADC possibilities and more on a component where you can remember the overall functionalities.
